#6-73 docker-compose to automate lengthy docker run command using volumes inter alia
version: '3'
services:
  # a service/container called 'web', to serve web pages (by alpine with express & node)
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    # 'web' as service/container name - build context (. - could be path) pwd with custom Dockerfile name
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - .:/apps
      # (1) do *not* try to map a folder against /app/node_modules in the container;
      # (2) map current working directory (outside container):/app folder in container
  # 6-78 another service/container  'tests' to run tests, re-running when the volume (of course code) is changed
  tests:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    # 'tests' as service/container name - build context (. - could be path) pwd with custom Dockerfile name
    #ports:
    #  - "3000:3000"
    # no ports needed as no server running inside tests container - solely for filesystem
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - .:/app
      # (1) do *not* try to map a folder against /app/node_modules in the container;
      # (2) map current working directory (outside container):/app folder in container
    command: ["npm", "run", "test"]
    # override starting command for this container
